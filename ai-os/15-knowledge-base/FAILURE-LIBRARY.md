# Book 16 — Failure Library / Escape Register (lessons, not blame)
Every production issue is an **Escape** (see `../05-qa/ESCAPE-LEARNING.md`). Record format below.
An Escape stays OPEN until the "prevented by" column names the permanent test/checklist/rule added.

| Date | Escape | Level | Gap type | Why it escaped | Fix + system improvement | Prevented-by (permanent) | Status |
|------|--------|-------|----------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 2026-06-27 | Live site briefly served the 2.7 KB dev shell instead of the bundle after a merge | L2 Process | Review + Evidence | Pages was in legacy "deploy from branch" mode; "all good" was assumed without checking the live artifact | Switched Pages Source to GitHub Actions; verify live artifact after every deploy | Release book rule "verify live after deploy"; byte-identical dist check in CI | Closed |
| 2026-06-27 | Handoff brief described a repo structure that wasn't committed (only the bundle was) | L2 Process | Evidence | Deployed build output but never committed source; brief trusted intent, not the repo | Committed full modular source; repo is the source of truth | CLAUDE.md golden rule + "repo is source of truth" in governance | Closed |
